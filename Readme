- User Profile -> Ability to see stats on performance, graphs of performance over time, etc. Allow them to have a deep data dive into their performance so they can see their growth over time. Data is beautiful
- Leaderboard with score -> based on someone performance there a given a score, there would be live rankings based on region or something, that would show the top comedians on the platform
